Evolution Skateboarding is a sports video game released by Konami for the GameCube and PlayStation 2 in 2002. It includes several popular skateboarders such as Rick McCrank, Arto Saari, Kerry Getz, and Danny Way. There is also a create-a-skater feature and an unlockable character for every skater the player completes the game as. There are also sets of level specific songs such as a metal-remix of the Metal Gear Solid theme and a Castlevania theme after unlocking the Vampire Hunter. Levels are unlocked by beating a certain amount of objectives in a current level, such as collecting items like boots and other objects, performing tricks in certain areas of a level, and grinding a certain amount of meters. The Evolution Skateboarding engine was used in the bonus skateboarding mode included in the PlayStation 2 version of Metal Gear Solid 2: Substance in 2003.

== Reception ==

The game received "generally unfavorable reviews" on both platforms according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. It is mostly considered as a bland rip-off of the Tony Hawk's series of skating games. In Japan, however, Famitsu gave both console versions each a score of 31 out of 40.
