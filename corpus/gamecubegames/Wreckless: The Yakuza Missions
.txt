Wreckless: The Yakuza Missions (Double S.T.E.A.L. in Japan) is a video game released on the GameCube, Xbox and PlayStation 2. The game is a driving game set in Hong Kong, in which the player completes missions.
The game's then-groundbreaking graphics for the Xbox made it successful for that platform, as it was specifically developed for that console rather than being a port. However, the GameCube and PlayStation 2 versions suffered from performance issues and did not sell well. In 2005, a Japanese only sequel was released for the Xbox called "Double S.T.E.A.L. The Second Clash".
