== Gameplay ==

The core gameplay involves collecting items and defeating the robots which have attacked various areas in Bikini Bottom, while crossing platforms and avoiding environmental hazards like spikes and flames. Some areas require different characters to beat, as each character has their own unique abilities. The player can control SpongeBob, Patrick, and Sandy. Switching characters requires the player to find a Bus Stop, upon using which the current character will switch to another, and using it again will switch back to the previous character, giving the player an option of two characters in each level. The default character throughout the game is SpongeBob; Sandy and Patrick do not share any levels as playable characters.
Throughout the game, the player will collect Shiny Objects, Socks, and Golden Spatulas. Shiny Objects are dropped by enemies and scattered throughout levels, and can be used to pay clams to progress through levels and unlock extra challenges. They can also be traded with Mr. Krabs for Golden Spatulas. Socks are placed in levels in harder to reach locations, and 10 of them can be traded to Patrick for a Golden Spatula. Golden Spatulas are used to unlock new areas in the game, and 75 of them are required to fight the final boss.
A new addition to the remake is a multiplayer horde mode in which two players face waves of robotic enemies. The mode includes cut content from the original game, including a fight against a robotic Squidward, a scrapped version of Patrick's dream, and a cut phase of the Robo-SpongeBob fight.

Development for Rehydrated began as early as January 2018, when THQ Nordic enlisted Purple Lamp Games as one of their developers. In March 2018, THQ Nordic announced plans for "the global revival of several game titles" for many older Nickelodeon properties. This led to speculation that they were planning to remake or re-release several Nickelodeon games, including Battle for Bikini Bottom.Rehydrated was first officially announced on June 5, 2019, in the days leading up to E3 2019. The game was not playable until Gamescom, which started August 20 that year, where visitors could get their hands on it at THQ Nordic's booth. On April 16, 2020, it was announced that the game will be released on June 23, 2020. iOS and Android versions of the game were released on January 21, 2021.The game is available in two limited editions on all platforms.

== Reception ==

SpongeBob SquarePants: Battle for Bikini Bottom – Rehydrated received "mixed or average reviews" according to Metacritic.IGN gave the game 5/10, saying that it "sinks under its reverence to nostalgia" and wrote, "[T]here are bright spots that remain fun almost two decades later, and there are pops of ingenuity in its reworking, but it does little to stand alongside the best, or even the pretty good, platformer remakes and remasters we've seen this generation." In its 2/10 review, GameSpot wrote that "remasters, ports, and remakes are nice because they make games more accessible to new audiences, and the ones that excel understand that some features from the game's era are antiquated and should be updated or removed. SpongeBob SquarePants: Battle for Bikini Bottom – Rehydrated flops like a fish out of water when it comes to this." They concluded that the game "winds up being an unpleasant nostalgia trip that nobody should pack their bags for."
