The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles video games have been produced since 1989, largely by Japanese video game manufacturer Konami.
The older TMNT games are mostly based on the 1987 TV series, with elements borrowed from the movies, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Adventures, action figures and the Mirage comics and role-playing books; the newer TMNT games are based on the 2003 TV series, the 2007 film, the 2012 TV series, the 2014 film, the 2018 TV series and IDW comics.
As of 1993, the first eleven TMNT video games had sold 18 million units worldwide, earning nearly $450 million in sales revenue.
