== Reviews ==
The Cincinnati Enquirer gave the PS2 version a score of four stars out of five and said that its characters "have an exaggerated action-figure look, but they move smoothly and have a robust collection of moves." However, Playboy gave the same version a score of 60% and said, "Unless you're desperate to see Captain Lou Albano in action again (and who isn't?), scant reason for a purchase presents itself. Casual wrestling fans can pass." BBC Sport gave said version a score of 56%, stating: "When you press a button to pull off a move there's far too long a wait for any action, and the game actually builds up a queue which can mean you are waiting for moves to happen before you can continue."
