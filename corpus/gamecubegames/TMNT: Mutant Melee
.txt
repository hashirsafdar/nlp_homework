Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Melee is a 2005 fighting video game developed by Konami. It is based on the 2003 Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles series.


== Plot ==
Though the game does not offer a main plot for the primary cast, Adventure Mode is the single-player option in which the player chooses a character to follow in a battle-to-battle style story with written synopsis between battles and tasks as they attempt to reach their ultimate goal.  The mode presents offshoot routes that allow you to choose different challenges and battles as you proceed.  
During progression, the player gathers token currency which can unlock extra content in the Library menu area.


== Gameplay ==
In the game there are 4 game modes: Last Man Standing, Knock Out, King of the Hill, and Keep Away. In Last Man Standing,
the goal is to be the last living player. Knock Out challenges the player to KO the most players in a set time or to reach a set amount of KO first. King of the Hill's goal is to get to a set number of points before the other players. To gain points, players must stand in the light beam that moves to set places on the map. Finally, the goal of Keep Away is to carry a chest to gain points. While carrying the chest, players are unable to attack. The carrier must run away from the other players because being hit will cause the carrier to drop the chest.
