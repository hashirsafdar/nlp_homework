They also stated that the visual effects of the game "looks good" and the audio "has a decent array of sound effects and music." The publication later named it the best PlayStation 2 game of May 2003. IGN said, "We wouldn't exactly crown Acclaim's motorcycle racer as videogame royalty." Eurogamer complained that the textures were "bland and blurry" and the scenery leaves no "lasting impression". But the bikes and riders are "suitably detailed" and "the crashes look sufficiently bone-shattering." Eurogamer said it "isn't a terrible game - it's just that it's so easily ignored."
