== Gameplay ==
Improving the career mode, the game was extensively advertised and released much sooner than the usual late October dates to avoid proximity with the release of Pro Evolution Soccer 4 and the EA Big release FIFA Street.
The game featured a return of create-a-player mode, as well as an improved, 15-season-long career mode. The game's biggest difference compared to previous titles was the inclusion of first-touch gameplay which provided gamers the ability to perform real-life tricks and passes. It was also the first version to feature the full Mexican League, which boosted sales in the United States. The soundtrack was headlined by British DJ Paul Oakenfold, who composed the "FIFA Theme" especially for the game. The soundtrack was Faithless, Ivete Sangalo, JoJo, Marcelo D2, Oomph!, Scissor Sisters and Seeed.
The main cover for the game featured Patrick Vieira, Fernando Morientes and Andriy Shevchenko. On the North American cover Oswaldo SÃ¡nchez replaced Vieira.John Motson provides commentary with Ally McCoist on special comments in the English version of the game.
In most territories, FIFA 2005 was the last game to release on the PlayStation console.The game's online servers were closed in 2008.
