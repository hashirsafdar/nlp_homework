== Overview ==
There are five different game modes; "Career", "UFC Mode", "Arcade", "Tournament" and "Exhibition". Career mode involves creating a fighter, giving him a fighting style, completing a number of "skill challenges" to build up his attributes, then winning five sparring matches before you can enter an eight-man tournament. After the tournament is over, the player picks a new fighting style to learn, and completes the same process until it has been done five times.
In UFC Mode, the player picks a heavyweight or light-heavyweight fighter and must win four fights before having a title match. On winning, the player receives a silver belt, which can later become a gold belt if UFC Mode is completed again with the same fighter. There is also an open-weight division, where the player can face fighters from outside their weight class.
In arcade mode the player selects a fighter and must win ten consecutive fights. Up to eight people can compete in the Tournament mode. Exhibition mode consists of single 1 vs. 1 fights.
The game cover features UFC fighter, Tito Ortiz and the late Charles Lewis Jr., better known as Mask, the founder of the TapouT brand. The full roster includes 28 fighters.
