MLB Slugfest is a series of baseball games developed by Sports Mogul, Gratuitous Games and Midway Games, and released by Midway Games for major console systems such as PlayStation 2, GameCube, and Xbox. The game bills itself as a more "street" style baseball game, including more mature / aggressive themes, the ability to attack other players, and urban-styled in-game commentary.
As of 2020, there are four versions of MLB Slugfest: 20-03, 20-04, Loaded and 2006.
Loaded is the only baseball game in history to get a "T" rating by the ESRB.
Slugfest 2006, the newest version of the four, has inspired a cult-following based on its glitches and overall hilarity.
The announcers in the game are Tim Kitzrow who also did the NHL Hitz, NBA Jam, and the NFL Blitz series and Jim/Jimmy Shorts who is voiced by Kevin Matthews.
