Shrek Super Party is a party video game released in 2002 by Mass Media. The game is based on the Shrek film series. The game is similar to Pac-Man Fever (which has the same developer) and the Mario Party series of games.


== Gameplay ==
The characters Shrek, Fiona, Donkey, Lord Farquaad, Thelonious, and Monsieur Hood are available for play.  Five realms are available for play, each with its own mini-games: The Keep, The Windmill, The Swamp, The Castle, and The Farm. The cover features four colored castles and four characters Shrek, Donkey, Princess Fiona, and Lord Farquaad. Some are team games and the teams are always restricted to P1/P3 vs P2/P4.
The purpose of the game Shrek Super Party is to be the first player to collect a certain number of "Precious Drops". This number can be preset in the "game settings" menu at the beginning of the game as anything between 200 and 800 in intervals of 100. The drops can be collected through making bug matches or by reaching "Realm Caches".
