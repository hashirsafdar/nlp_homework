XGIII: Extreme G Racing, also known as Extreme-G 3, is a racing video game developed by Acclaim Studios Cheltenham and published by Acclaim Entertainment for PlayStation 2 and GameCube. The game is followed by XGRA: Extreme G Racing Association.


== Gameplay ==

It follows a simulator-style look into team racing of the 23rd century, specifically, the existence of Extreme-G racing. The player takes the role of one of the twelve riders, each representing one of the six teams of two, all of which vie for glory in the Championship. The game career mode starts in the slowest class, 250G, and as the player progresses through the career, they will eventually make it into the 1000G class, the fastest in the game.

10 tracks are included, with twists, drops, and sharp turns. Extreme-G 3 handles weaponry differently, resulting in a significant change in gameplay from the first and second games. While in the first and second games, the player could pick up weapons on the track, and firing these weapons would not consume their primary weapon bar, in the third game, the player purchases weapons with money won, and firing weapons consumes a small amount of the weapon bar for each shot. Compared to the previous games, Extreme-G 3 offers fewer weapons.


== Reception ==

Extreme-G 3 received "favorable" reviews on both platforms according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. Gary Whitta of Next Generation called the PlayStation 2 version "a solid, slick-feeling plaything for fans of Wipeout-style racers". It was nominated for GameSpot's annual "Best Driving Game" prize among console games, which went to Gran Turismo 3: A-Spec.
