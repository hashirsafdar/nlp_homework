== Gameplay ==
Players skate around each level performing various tricks, using either characters from Disney/Pixar's Toy Story, Disney's Tarzan, and Disney's The Lion King, or with a fully customizable human skater. There are three main modes: Adventure, Free Skate, and Versus. In Adventure, the player will take on a variety of skate challenges across the three worlds. All skaters are restricted to their respective worlds, but the human skater can move in and out of any world. In Free Play, the player is free to play as any skater, but all challenges are disabled, and the restrictions on which world the skater is playable still apply. In Versus, two players can play any skater in any world and compete in a series of skate games.
