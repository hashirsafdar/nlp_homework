NCAA College Basketball 2K3 is an American college basketball video game which was initially released on December 2, 2002 for the Xbox, PlayStation 2 and GameCube. It is the only title in the series that uses the "College Basketball" designation rather than "College Hoops". It features former Duke Blue Devils guard Jay Williams on the cover.  
NCAA College Basketball 2K3 was the only title in the series to appear on the GameCube, as well as being the GameCube's only college basketball game. The GameCube version of the game was released in limited quantities, and it is now considered one of the rarest titles available for the system.
