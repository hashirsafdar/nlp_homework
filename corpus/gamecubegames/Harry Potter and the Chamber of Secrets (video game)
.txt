== Gameplay ==
The game's core gameplay is straightforward. Taking control of Harry, the player explores Hogwarts castle and grounds. Throughout the course of the game, the player will encounter events that tie into the storyline of the second book. Filling the gaps between these events are various classes, where the player will learn how to fly a broomstick and learn new spells for combating bosses, among other things. Each new spell is accompanied by a challenge, which the player must get through in a certain amount of time to complete that class period. During the later parts of the game, the player will face challenges which are not time-limited and are not related to learning spells. These challenges are all based on events from the book, for example, travelling into the Forbidden Forest and gathering ingredients for a potion Hermione is making.


== Versions ==
The PlayStation version of the game is a sequel to the Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone game and was also developed by Argonaut Games. It retains many elements and graphics from its predecessor but with some places in Hogwarts being expanded or moved as well as new mini-games that are played as the storyline progresses. Unlike other versions, most of the new spells learned from attending classes are upgrades from the previous game.
There are also slight differences between the three other console versions of the game. The GameCube, PlayStation 2 and Xbox versions of the game allow the player to access a broom and enter free-flight mode. While the PlayStation 2 version allows the player to land anywhere they want, in the Xbox and GameCube version the landing zones are limited. In the GameCube version, there is an exclusive feature involving GCâ€“GBA connectivity that allows a secret room to be opened in the GC version when connected with the GBA version of the game. The PC/Mac version of the game, which was created by a different developer than the console versions, features completely different levels and gameplay from the console cousins. The game features the same graphics and character design as the Philosopher's Stone (PC). It also retains some of the spells learned in the previous game and involves the player learning new spells by attending more classes at Hogwarts. The Game Boy Color version is a typical role-playing game. However, Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, Hermione Granger and Gilderoy Lockhart are all playable characters at various points in the game. The Game Boy Advance version has the fewest spells. It is based on the PS2/Xbox/GC and Mac versions. It is mostly made up of mini-quests (unlike other versions).
