== Plot ==
Hundreds of years ago, the evil ghost king Spooky terrorized Pac-Land and the Pac-People. To stop him, the Great Wizard Pac created a powerful potion to transform five ordinary fruit into magical Golden Fruit. The knight Sir Pac-A-Lot defeated Spooky in battle, and used the Golden Fruit to seal him under a tree in the center of Pac-Village.
In the present day, Blinky, Inky, Pinky and Clyde sneak into Pac-Village at night to steal the Golden Fruit from the tree, unaware of its purpose. In doing so, they unwittingly release Spooky, who commands them to aid his plan to eliminate all Pac-People. The ghosts agree and each take one of the Golden Fruit. The next morning, Professor Pac informs Pac-Man of the trouble and asks him to retrieve the stolen Golden Fruit in order to save Pac-Land. Pac-Man travels throughout Pac-Land and across the ocean to Ghost Island, defeating the ghosts and retrieving the Golden Fruit along the way. Pac-Man eventually returns to Pac-Village, where he is ambushed by Spooky. The power of the Golden Fruit transforms Pac-Man into a new golden form, and he defeats Spooky once more, sealing him back beneath the tree. The residents of Pac-Village emerge to congratulate Pac-Man, while his dog Chomp Chomp overhears the ghosts planning to free Spooky again and chases them out of the village.


== Gameplay ==
Pac-Man World 2 is a 3D platforming game, where the player controls Pac-Man and must navigate him to the end of each level. Pac-Man has multiple abilities including the Rev Roll, which can be used to launch Pac-Man over long gaps; the Butt-Bounce, which can press switches and attack enemies from above; and a jumping Flip Kick to strike airborne enemies. Eating special Power Pellets will also give Pac-Man temporary power-ups, such as turning him to metal, shrinking him in size, or allowing him to eat ghost enemies. Pac-Man possesses a health bar with only three segments; if his health is depleted, the player will lose a life and be sent back to the previous checkpoint. Each level features Pac-Dots and fruit to collect, which will increase the player's score for the level. After completing any non-boss level, the player can choose to replay it in Time Trial mode, challenging the player to reach the end as quickly as possible. During the time trial, fruits and other collectibles in the level are replaced by clocks, which will temporarily stop the timer if collected. If Pac-Man loses a life during the time trial, he must restart the level from the beginning.
The game features 25 levels: the Pac-Village tutorial level, followed by six different themed areas with four levels each. The last level of each area features a boss battle with one or more of the primary ghost enemies, who must be defeated to advance. Most levels feature one of 15 collectible Galaxian flagships, which will allow Pac-Man to play a bonus maze level in the style of the classic Pac-Man games. Non-boss levels also feature collectible arcade tokens. Eight are hidden in each level, while bonus tokens can be earned by collecting all the fruit and Pac-Dots in a level and completing time trials. By collecting certain numbers of tokens, players can unlock emulated versions of older Pac-Man titles in the Pac-Village arcade, including Pac-Man, Pac-Attack, Pac-Mania, and Ms. Pac-Man. Collecting tokens will also unlock a jukebox, which enables the player to listen to the game's soundtrack, and a concept art gallery. The Game Boy Advance version does not feature any unlockable emulations.
For the game's Japanese PlayStation 2 release, the difficulty was rebalanced and made simpler compared to the North American and European releases, with certain levels shortened and bosses' health reduced.
