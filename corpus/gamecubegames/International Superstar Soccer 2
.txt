International Superstar Soccer 2 is a football video game in the International Superstar Soccer series by Konami. Unlike other football games by Konami it only features international teams. Initially being released on the Gamecube, it became possible to play the game on a Nintendo Wii also, introducing the game to a new generation of players, as with every original Gamecube game. Goals could come from a variety of sources; crosses, corners, penalties, free kicks, passing plays, solo runs, lobbed efforts and long range drives. The game continued the trend of having player's with different attributes, both visually and with regards to their style on the pitch; pacey wingers out wide, large target men up front, shorter centre forwards trying to cause problems for defenders with their skill running on the ball.
