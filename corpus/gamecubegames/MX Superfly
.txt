Players are able to create a male or female MX rider of their own and play in either two modes: racing or freestyle.  The former consists of races against opposing racers controlled by artificial intelligence, while the latter consists of levels taking place in various environments where the player must independently accomplish certain challenges. It is also possible to play with a friend in split screen multiplayer, and the Xbox version exclusively featured downloadable content consisting of extra soundtracks, riders and bikes that could be purchased from the Xbox Live service.
