XGRA: Extreme-G Racing Association is a futuristic racing video game, the fourth and final installment in the Extreme-G series, following Extreme-G 3. This game features more tracks as well as a brand new weapon system.


== Overview ==

Gameplay is similar but slightly different to previous games in the series. XGRA features a wide range of riders, tracks and bikes that can accelerate at an incredibly rapid rate, going from 0 to 300 mph (0 to 483 km/h) in a matter of seconds. A returning feature is the ability to break the sound barrier: upon reaching 750 mph, all sound effects will cut out, except for item collection sound, other rider's taunts, weapons firing, and in-game music.
XGRA allows players to race for 8 different teams, with each team's bike having their own advantages and drawbacks such as Regeneration, Handling, Speed, Acceleration and Shielding.


== Reception ==

XGRA: Extreme-G Racing Association received "average" reviews on all platforms according to the review aggregation website Metacritic.
