The Aleck 64 is the Nintendo 64 design in arcade form, designed by SETA in cooperation with Nintendo, and sold from 1998 to 2003 only in Japan. It essentially consists of a Nintendo 64 board retrofitted with the sound capabilities which are standard for arcade games of the time. Nintendo and SETA began working on their agreement for the board in 1996, hoping to recreate the business model Namco and Sony Computer Entertainment displayed with the Namco System 11, to facilitate conversions of arcade games.
