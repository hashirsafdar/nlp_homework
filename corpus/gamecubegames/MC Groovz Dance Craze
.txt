Spin mode adds four additional directions. Its songs are also longer than other dance games, often lasting around seven minutes.The game also includes three extra modes of play: Dance Workout (tracks calories burned during play), Dance Together (two-player cooperative), and Dance Faceoff (two-player face-off).

== Reception ==

IGN has said that it is "Playable, but not fun." and suggests that "The footwork doesn't match the music.". In regards to the workout mode, GameSpot said while it can count calories, it has no other differences from normal mode.


== Lawsuit ==
On May 9, 2005, Konami filed a complaint against Roxor Games claiming an infringement of rights related to their dance game product In the Groove.
