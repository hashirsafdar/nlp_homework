Monster Jam is a live motorsport event tour and television show operated by Feld Entertainment. The series is sanctioned under the umbrella of the United States Hot Rod Association (USHRA) and takes place primarily in the United States. Although individual event formats can vary greatly based on the "intermission" entertainment, the main attraction is always the racing and freestyle competitions by monster trucks. 
Several licensed Monster Jam video games have been made, generally under the Monster Jam brand name, with the first one being released during the sixth generation of video games.  The rights to publish licensed Monster Jam video games were first granted to Ubisoft and have changed hands several times over the years to Activision, Game Mill Entertainment and THQ Nordic.  At least one Monster Jam game has been available on each the following platforms: Game Boy Advance, GameCube, Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 2, Nintendo DS, PlayStation 3, Wii, Xbox 360, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Google Stadia.  After losing the license for Monster Jam following the release of Monster 4x4: Masters of Metal, Ubisoft continued to make independent sequels for it that would make Monster 4x4 an independent series of its own that offered a more unique monster truck racing experience.
