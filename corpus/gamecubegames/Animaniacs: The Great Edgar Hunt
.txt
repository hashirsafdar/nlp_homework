Animaniacs: The Great Edgar Hunt is an action-adventure video game, released in North America, Europe and Australia in 2005. It is based on the cartoon series Animaniacs from Warner Bros. and features the same voice actors for the main characters. The game is one of multiple Animaniacs video games. It was the first Animaniacs-related project to be released since the animated comedy film Wakko's Wish in 1999.

A North American PlayStation 2 and Xbox version of the game were advertised but never released.


== Plot ==
Frustrated by being "overlooked", film director C. C. Deville steals the "Edgars" (statuettes that are a parody of the Oscars) and threatens to melt them all unless studio chairman Thaddeus Plotz gives him a lucrative contract. While carrying out his evil plot, Deville's dim-witted assistant accidentally crashes his getaway blimp into the Warner Bros. water tower. This scatters 44 of the 45 stolen Edgars across the studio lot and releases Yakko, Wakko, and Dot, who agree to search for the missing awards. The many different types of levels include: Western, Horror Movie, Fairy Tale, O'Sullivan Mines, and Epic. The final level takes place in the sky chasing and shooting down Deville's blimp.
