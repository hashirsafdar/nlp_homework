NHL Hitz Pro is an ice hockey video game developed by Next Level Games and published by Midway Games, in the NHL Hitz series. It was released on September 25, 2003, for the PlayStation 2, GameCube, and Xbox. Unlike the previous titles in the series, it has 5-on-5 gameplay instead of the usual 3-on-3 gameplay with the earlier titles. The game does not include penalty shots, and it is still an arcade-type hockey game like its predecessors. It also has a lot of hard hitting. The cover athlete of the game is Nicklas Lidstr√∂m, and features commentary from Tim Kitzrow and Harry Teinowitz.
NHL Hitz Pro had the IIHF license, enabling it to use the jerseys of the Olympic hockey teams.
The game also has many game modes, one of the most popular being the "Pick-Up Hockey" game mode, where the game would turn into either a roller, street, or pond hockey match-up between two amateur teams.


== Features ==

Among the changes to Hitz Pro are 5-on-5 gameplay, as opposed to the 3-on-3 action seen in NHL Hitz 2002 and 2003, less exaggerated player appearances and wrap arounds.


== Reception ==
