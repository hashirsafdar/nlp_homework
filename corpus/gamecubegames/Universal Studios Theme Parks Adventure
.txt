Universal Studios Theme Parks Adventure, known in Japan as Universal Studios Japan Adventure (ユニバーサル・スタジオ・ジャパン・アドベンチャー, Yunibāsaru sutajio japan adobenchā), is a 2001 video game developed by Nai'a Digital Works and published by Kemco for the GameCube. Set in the Universal Studios Japan park, the object of the game is to complete several mini-games loosely based on the real-life attractions Back to the Future: The Ride, Jaws, Jurassic Park River Adventure, E.T. Adventure, Backdraft, Wild, Wild, Wild West Stunt Show, and Waterworld. There is also a Movie Quiz, in which the player must answer trivia questions about the Universal Studios films. The game was panned by critics for its poor gameplay and tedious minigames.


== Gameplay ==
The object of the game is to collect stamps by going on rides throughout the park. To get on the rides, the player needs points, collected from picking up trash around the park and putting it into trash cans. The player can also meet and shake hands with costumed characters inside the park for additional points. The game uses a fixed camera that does not move or zoom in with the player. There are set camera vantages that the player moves in and out of by going outside of the field of view to go to the next camera point. Rides include Back to the Future: The Ride, Jaws, Jurassic Park River Adventure, and E.T. Adventure. Minigames, hosted by Woody Woodpecker, include a Universal Studios quiz of film-related questions and puzzle games such as Concentration (memory match).


== Reception ==

Matt Casamassina of IGN criticized the game's graphics, comparing it to a "bad N64 game", and noted that the game still suffered frame-rate issues. UGO rated the game #78 on their list of "The Worst Video Games of All Time." It remained NGC Magazine UK's lowest-rated GameCube game until surpassed by Batman: Dark Tomorrow.
