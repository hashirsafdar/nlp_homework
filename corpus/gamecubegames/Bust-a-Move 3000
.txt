Super Puzzle Bobble, released as Super Bust-A-Move in Europe and North America, is a puzzle video game in the Puzzle Bobble series. It was developed by Taito, and released on November 26, 2000 by Acclaim Entertainment for the PlayStation 2 and Windows. It was later ported to the Game Boy Advance on November 27, 2001. It was re-released in Japan for the PlayStation 2 in 2004 as part of Super Puzzle Bobble DX (along with its sequel, Super Puzzle Bobble 2), which is Volume 62 of the Japan-exclusive Simple 2000 Series. This compilation includes a few graphical enhancements.
Super Puzzle Bobble was ported to the GameCube in 2003, under the name of Super Puzzle Bobble All-Stars in Japan, Super Bust-A-Move All-Stars in Europe, and Bust-A-Move 3000 in North America. The game is a direct port, except for the inclusion of new backgrounds and remixed music. It also features new box artwork, more in line with the in-game artwork.
It is the first mainstream game in the series not to see an arcade release, although there is an arcade game with the same title, which is a completely different game to this one.

=== Critical reception ===

Ryan Davis of GameSpot said the PS2 version of the game has the best graphics and sound of the series to date, "with extraordinarily sharp 2D graphics and a healthy amount of visual splendor", but that its gameplay represents an "incredibly stripped-down" disappointment to the series which "brings virtually nothing new to the franchise" and is missing a lot of features from the previous year's Bust-a-Move 4. As for the GameCube version, there was nothing new and the analog controls were awkward, but the multiple gameplay modes kept players happy. A reviewer on NGC Magazine regarded the game as worth owning, but only on one console. A reviewer on Next Generation found the game a bit disappointing and no different from the original game.


=== Promotion ===
The game was showcased at the February 1999 AOU Amusement Expo in Japan.
