== Gameplay ==

The objective of the game is to defeat an opponent in a set amount of time and rounds. There are three types of gameplay. First is Challenge mode, where the player fights a set of characters (the opponents are the enemies of the character chosen from classic Tom and Jerry cartoons) until either Monster Jerry, a bigger and scary mutated Jerry, or Robot Cat, one of Tom's creations, is fought and knocked out. Another is Versus, where a basic one-on-one fight is held. The last is Tag Battle, where a player works alone or with a friend to fight two enemies.
The four modes of play are single player, versus, tag team, and team play. New characters are unlocked if the player wins against the computer. Characters include Tom, Jerry, Butch, Spike, Tyke, Robot Cat, Eagle, Lion, Nibbles, Monster Jerry, and Duckling, who use more than 75 weapons to beat each other with. Costumes are also unlocked, allowing specific characters to have more attire. Twelve destructible environments include a kitchen, beach, snowy winter, cruise ship, junk yard, unstable construction site, Italian market, haunted house, mad scientist lab, western town, castle, Hell, and a boxing arena.
