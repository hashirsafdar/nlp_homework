RedCard 20-03, known as RedCard in Europe, is a video game based on association football, released in 2002 by Point of View.  The game follows most of the rules of football, but allows for heavy tackles and special moves once the player has charged up a special meter.
The game, released on the Nintendo GameCube, Xbox, and PlayStation 2, allows the player to compete across all the continents (including Antarctica) in a world conquest mode, which in turn unlocks the finals mode (World Cup). On each continent, the player begins against an easy team and faces increasingly more difficult opponents.
Brian McBride is depicted in the game's American cover art.
