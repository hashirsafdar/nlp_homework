The game allows players to select one of several wacky cartoon characters and skateboard through a variety of cel-shaded levels. The objective of the game is to steer characters into a variety of classic cartoon "mishaps" (usually involving inflicting pain on the character in some way) and then chaining one mishap directly into another to create combos.
There is also a versus mode offering five different game types, which can be played with two players or against the computer.
