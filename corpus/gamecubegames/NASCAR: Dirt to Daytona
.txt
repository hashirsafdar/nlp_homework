NASCAR: Dirt to Daytona is a racing simulator developed by Monster Games and published by Infogrames in November 2002 for the PlayStation 2 and Nintendo GameCube. It features NASCAR's Dodge Weekly Racing Series (the only game to feature this series), Featherlite Modified Tour, Craftsman Truck Series, and the NASCAR Cup Series (originally, Winston was the title sponsor but due to ESRB rating, all tobacco and alcohol related brands were censored). The Dodge Weekly Racing Series and Featherlite Modified Tour rosters consist of generic fantasy drivers. The Craftsman Truck Series also features fantasy drivers alongside real ones. The unique feature of having to work your way up through the ranks from the low tier Weekly Racing Series to the Cup Series would later return in EA Sports' NASCAR 2005: Chase for the Cup.
Strangely, pit stops and yellow flags are absent in the Featherlite Modified Tour despite both being included in real life.


== Reception ==

The game received "favorable" reviews on both platforms according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. It won GameSpot's annual "Best Driving Game on GameCube" award.
