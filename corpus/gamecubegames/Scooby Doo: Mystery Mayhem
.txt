Scooby-Doo! Mystery Mayhem is a video game based on the Hanna-Barbera/Warner Bros. cartoon Scooby-Doo. The game was developed by Artificial Mind and Movement and published by THQ in 2003 for the Game Boy Advance. It was later released for the PlayStation 2, GameCube, and Xbox in 2004.


== Plot ==
When Scooby and the gang discover someone has released thousands of real ghosts and monsters from a magic book called The Tome of Doom, they race to solve mysteries and put the monsters back.


== Gameplay ==
The player controls two characters, Shaggy Rogers and Scooby-Doo, as they progress through five levels, solving mysteries for Mystery Inc. Shaggy and Scooby get to switch places when the player wants to play either as Shaggy or Scooby, find a clue then report it to Velma Dinkley and can defeat certain monsters, using the Tome of Doom. Each character has a different ability. Certain levels feature only one playable character. The Tome of Doom can be charged up using magical wisps which the player can collect along their way, when the Tome of Doom is either low on magic or runs out. The player characters have a  'cool meter', which when empty, causes the player to lose control of the character. The player can refill this meter by consuming Scooby Snacks or other foods found in the level. Certain food items are counted as collectibles and unlock bonuses if the player finds all of them within a particular level.


== Reception ==

Mystery Mayhem was met with mixed reception. GameRankings and Metacritic gave it a score of 53.20% and 53 out of 100 for the Game Boy Advance version; 59.82% and 56 out of 100 for the Xbox version; 59.52% and 55 out of 100 for the PlayStation 2 version; and 55.75% and 54 out of 100 for the GameCube version.
