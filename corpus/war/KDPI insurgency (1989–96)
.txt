The insurgency by the Kurdish Democratic Party of Iran surged in 1989, lasting until 1996, as part of the Kurdish separatism struggle. The eruption of the conflict in July 1989 was caused by the assassination of KDPI leader Abdul Rahman Qassemlou by suspected Iranian government agents. The most violent episodes took place in 1990 and 1991, when Kurdish soldiers launched massive attacks on Iranian military bases in Kurdish areas of Iran. This brought heavy retaliation from the Iranian government, aiming to eradicate the KDPI leadership by assassinating Sadegh Sharafkandi and other KDPI leaders in 1992 in order to disable the Kurdish party's ability to function. The conflict faded with the effective targeted assassination policy of Iran and by 1996 KDPI was no longer able to function militarily and announced a unilateral ceasefire. The conflict claimed hundreds of lives, mostly Iranian government troops and Kurdish militants.


== Background ==

In 1979, a wide scale rebellion erupted, as the Kurdish Democratic Party of Iran and its Kurdish allies resisted the new regime. As the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps fought to reestablish government control in the Kurdish regions, more than 10,000 Kurds were killed during this process.Pockets of KDPI insurgents continued to engage in low level fighting up until 1983, as the Iranian forces were diverted to the Iraqi front, with the escalation of the Iran–Iraq War.
While most of its military and political activity in Iran was greatly overpowered after the 1979 rebellion, the Kurdish Democratic Party of Iran (KDPI) had continued its opposition activities through 1980s. Nevertheless, the crackdown still continued—'Abd al-Rahman Qassemlou, leader of Kurdish Democratic Party of Iran, was assassinated in July 1989 by the Iranian government.The immediate pretext for the renewed insurgency of KDPI was the event of February 1990, when thousands of Kurds demonstrated in seven Iranian towns and more than 500 were subsequently arrested. These protests are said to be due to the execution of 17 Kurdish activists. As a result of the crackdown, the KDPI renewed its military activities.

In the autumn, Kurdish soldiers resumed their fighting against the Iranian Revolutionary Guards.
On November 15, 1993 Iran blows up a car in Iraqi Kurdistan killing six including 5 KDPI members. This and other incidents make both the UN and Amnesty International accuse the Iranian government of the political assassination of members of its Kurdish opposition.


=== 1994 ===

On June 5, another two members of an Iranian Kurdish group were shot down in Iraqi Kurdistan by Iranian government agents, according to the State Department's yearly report on terrorism. On August 4, 1995 The Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan said that Iranian government agents had assassinated its representative in Baghdad. Tehran denied the charges and claimed that the killings had been the result of political infighting among opposition forces.In September and October, an Iranian Kurdish opposition group accused Iranian officials of torturing and executing ten Kurdish political prisoners who supported a banned political group, Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan (KDPI). Another 345 people were also arrested at this time for the same infraction.Military clashes resumed on December 4, 1995, as the Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan killed 15 members of the Iranian security force in clashes in western Iran.

On July 10, Iranian agents exploded a car-bomb near a housing complex amidst the main concentration of KDPI refugee camps in northern Iraq. On July 28, Rahman Radjabi Hamvand, a member of KDPI, was executed. The charges against him stemmed from a complaint by a private individual that was later withdrawn.
On July 29, 1996, 3,000 Iranian troops entered Kurdish territory in northern Iraq in search of KDPI guerillas, reportedly killing 20 members of KDPI, while displacing over 2,000 Iranian Kurd refugees. Iranian officials claimed that the attack was justified on the basis of self-defense
Following the operation, on August 4, 1996, KDPI members announced that they will stop crossborder attacks from Iraq into Iran.


== Aftermath ==
Following the unilateral cease-fire announcement of 1996, the conflict of KDPI against the Iranian regime shifted to the political opposition. On April 1997, improved relations between Tehran and Ankara led to the deportation from Turkey to northern Iraq over 70 KDPI members. On April 13, Iranian Kurds accused Iranian officials of trying to poison KDPI members, after 85 Iranian Kurds were treated for food poisoning with a highly toxic substance.The pressure upon the KDPI eased since the election of the moderate Mohammad Khatami's government in 1997.On February 16, 1999, The arrest of PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan leads to riots by Kurds in Iran, especially in western Iran, as well as throughout Europe.
Renewed insurgency in Iranian Kurdistan was undertaken since 2004 by another Kurdish organization—the Party for the Free Life in Kurdistan (PJAK).

On January 2014, Iranian forces killed a KDPI party member, while he was disseminating leaflets.In September 2014, in a number of clashes, the KDPI engaged Iranian security for the first time in many years, killing at least 6 Iranian soldiers. It was unclear whether this was a result of change of policy by the Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan (which evaded violence since 1996) or an isolated sequence of incidents.
In May 2015, a suspected Iranian attack (allegedly disguised as PKK fighters) on PJAK force on Iranian–Iraqi Kurdistan border resulted in 6 killed—2 KDPI and 4 PKK (or allegedly Iranian agents).
In June 2015, a PDKI attack on Revolutionary Guard forces reportedly left 6 people killed.In 2016, the PDKI resumed its military insurgency against Iran.
