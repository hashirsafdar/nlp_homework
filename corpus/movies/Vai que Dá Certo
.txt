== Plot ==
The film follows the reunion of five young adult friends who share the frustration of not having achieved the success they wanted in their lives. The possibility to recover the time they lost arises through a tempting and risky proposal: the assault of a carrier of values. The supposedly perfect crime that promised to transform their trajectories fulfills its purpose, but not exactly as planned.
