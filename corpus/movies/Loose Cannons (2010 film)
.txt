== Plot summary ==
The Cantones are a bourgeois family who own a pasta company in Lecce in conservative Southern Italy. One of the two sons, Tommaso (Riccardo Scamarcio), returns from his studies in Rome and hopes to use a dinner with his family and the Brunettis, their business partners, to reveal his homosexuality. He expects his father Vincenzo will want nothing to do with him and he will be free to pursue his dream of becoming a writer without any ties to the family business. Tommaso discusses his plan with his elder brother, Antonio (Alessandro Preziosi). During dinner, just as Tommaso is about to share his news, Antonio interrupts and reveals that he himself is homosexual. Vincenzo (Ennio Fantastichini) takes the news badly, has a minor heart attack and is admitted to hospital.
Rejecting his gay son, Vincenzo decides to place Tommaso in charge of the family business. Tommaso changes his mind about revealing his homosexuality, fearing his announcement could kill his father. Tommaso adapts to his new role partnering with the Brunetti daughter and drawing his sister into the business. His life is made more difficult when his boyfriend, Marco (Carmine Recano), and three other gay friends decide to visit him at his family home.
