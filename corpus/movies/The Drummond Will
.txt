== Plot ==
Following the death of their father, two sons inherit a decrepit cottage in a small British village in the middle of nowhere. They soon find the building also contains a large sum of unexpected cash, and through a combination of bad luck and very poor judgment they soon find themselves having to deal with an increasing body count of elderly villagers while attempting to avoid suspicion.

== Critical response ==
Critical reaction at film festivals was positive - it debuted at the Woods Hole Film Festival where it won the Best Film (Comedy) award, and later won various other festival awards including the Best International Feature award at the Big Island Film Festival. Dennis Harvey, reviewing the film for Variety, called it "an agreeable Ealing-meets-Farrelly feel on modest means" that will "amuse casual viewers and delight genre fans". George Haymont of the Huffington Post called it "one of the most refreshingly inventive and lovingly crafted send-ups of a beloved genre to be seen in many a moon" and is "the blackest of comedies and a joyful romp rolled into one very pleasing package".

The film was released theatrically in the US in July 2011, with a DVD and Blu-ray release in August 2011 in the UK.
