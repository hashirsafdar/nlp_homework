== Plot summary ==
Having made a career of seducing rich older women, Maximo marries a wealthy woman more than twice his age. 25 years later, spoiled, out of shape and bored from waking up next to his now 80-year-old wife, he gets the surprise of his life when she ends up dumping him for a younger McLaren car salesman.
Forced out of his mansion and desperate for a place to stay, he contacts Rick, another pampered gigolo. He crashes in the upscale playhouse of the woman's granddaughter, which does not go over very well. He soon moves in with his estranged sister, Sara, and her nerdy son, Hugo, in their small apartment. During this time, two things occur:

Anxious to return to the lap of luxury, Maximo uses his nephew's crush on classmate Arden to get to his new target: her grandmother, Celeste (a widowed billionaire that Rick is also targeting). Maximo tries to reignite his charm as a Latin lover, and fails at it miserably. Sara comes to know of her brother's scamming and kicks him out.
While teaching Hugo some tricks he thinks work on women, Maximo finds himself bonding with his nephew, and this opens his heart to being less selfish and more thoughtful of others.Eventually, Maximo becomes a gigolo for the woman Rick used to live with, and he patches up the relationship with his sister and nephew.
