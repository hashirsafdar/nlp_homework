Reilly, Terri is an emotionally powerful character study."A.O. Scott of the New York Times said, "What lifts Terri above its peers is not the plight of its protagonist or the film's sympathy for him, but rather the care and craft that the director, Azazel Jacobs, has brought to fairly conventional material" and Betsy Sharkey of the Los Angeles Times called it, "...impossible not to love".
