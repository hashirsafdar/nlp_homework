== Reception ==
Variety's Richard Kuipers called the film "a reasonably amusing 'American Pie'-like account of a randy Hong Kong teenagerâ€™s sexual awakening [that] . . . gradually becomes flaccid as its protag enters adulthood".  Derek Elley of Film Business Asia thought the film was better directed than Wu's previous efforts and "well-staged", with  "lots of t&a, lots of harmless softcore sex, and lots of juvenile Cantonese comedy".
