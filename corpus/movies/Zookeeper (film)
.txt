== Plot ==
In 2004, zookeeper Griffin Keyes (Kevin James) proposes to Stephanie (Leslie Bibb), but is turned down, citing his career as a zookeeper as the reason, breaking his heart.
Five years later in 2009, Griffin is now head  zookeeper at the Franklin Park Zoo, caring deeply for the animals. That night, Griffin holds an engagement party there for his brother Dave (Nat Faxon), but freaks out when he discovers that Stephanie was invited. Dave suggests Griffin come work with him at his car dealership to get Stephanie back, so Griffin considers doing it.
The animals hold a meeting that evening as they feel Griffin is the best zookeeper, so they decide to find some way to help him win back Stephanie. Jerome the brown bear (Jon Favreau) suggests they teach Griffin their mating techniques, but Joe the lion (Sylvester Stallone) protests, reminding them that it's against the animal code to talk to humans. Donald, the tufted capuchin (Adam Sandler), suggests that they make Griffin look like a hero when Stephanie is at the zoo tomorrow.
The next day, Donald lets Joe out, who confronts Stephanie and Dave's fiancée Robin (Steffiana de la Cruz). Griffin ruins the animals' plan by failing to jump into the lion enclosure, and instead the vet Kate (Rosario Dawson), captures Joe. When he climbs out of the enclosure, Joe accidently yells "What is wrong with you!?" at Griffin in frustration, causing Griffin to believe he has gone mad. That night, all the animals break the code of silence and tell Griffin they will teach him to win back Stephanie. He learns their different mating rituals, ending up humiliating himself at a party in front of the other zookeepers and the guests.
Griffin then has a talk with Bernie (Nick Nolte), a forlorn Western lowland gorilla who has spent years in a deep enclosure after allegedly attacking a zookeeper named Shane (Donnie Wahlberg). Bernie tells Griffin that Shane fell when he was abusing him, but lied, saying that Bernie attacked him. This caused Bernie to mistrust humans.
Griffin discovers that Stephanie is dating another ex-boyfriend, a bully named Gale (Joe Rogan). Joe's mate Janet (Cher) tells Griffin that the best way to attract a female is to be seen with another female, so Griffin asks Kate to go with him to Dave and Robin's wedding. 
Griffin successively grabs Stephanie's attention by first showing off with Kate, then standing up to Gale. Stephanie asks him out to dinner and after they go to a fashion show. Stephanie convinces Griffin to quit his job and he accepts Dave's job offer. This upsets Kate, and also Bernie, who tells him that Griffin quitting proves that he can't trust humans. As he leaves, Griffin warns Shane not to hurt Bernie. Kate decides to leave the zoo and accepts a job in Nairobi.
Griffin becomes a star employee at the car dealership but misses working at the zoo. When Stephanie proposes he refuses, dumping her when he realizes that she doesn't truly love him as an individual and that their relationship was all conditional to her. He then goes to the zoo, apologizing to Bernie who he sees has been beaten by Shane. The animals tell him that Kate is heading to the airport, so Griffin heads out to stop her, stopping at Shane's first to punish him for hurting Bernie. Then, with Bernie's help, Griffin manages to catch Kate on the bridge and confess his love for her. 
Six months later, Griffin and Kate get married and are back at the zoo and Bernie is now living in a new enclosure where he gets a great view of the city.

=== Critical response ===
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 14% based on reviews from 131 critics and an average rating of 3.41/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "Zookeeper smothers Kevin James's [sic] with a sodden script and a surfeit of jokes inappropriate for the young viewers who would be intrigued by its juvenile storyline." On Metacritic, the film has a score of 30 out of 100 based on 29 critics, indicating "generally unfavorable reviews". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of "B+" on an A+ to F scale.Brian Lowry of Variety called it "a marketing pitch in search of a movie" and a "punishingly flat effort that offers barely enough comedy to populate a three-minute trailer." Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter said "it's dreadful in every respect" and called it an "archly mirthless comedy". Despite his criticism he offers some small praise: "Although one would never have expected to find her in a film like this, Dawson, by dint of enthusiasm, is the only actor who rises above the material with her dignity intact." Ignatiy Vishnevetsky, who co-hosts the film review series Ebert Presents: At the Movies, said that "even though the movie looks hilarious from the trailer, it is only hilarious if you enjoy seeing Kevin James fall down a lot". He gave the film a "thumbs down," as did Christy Lemire, the other co-host of the series. In May 2011, RedLetterMedia (creators of the Mr. Plinkett reviews) did an episode of the show Half in the Bag reviewing the film's first trailer. The hosts sarcastically praised the trailer as if they thought it was a fake, well crafted parody of a tired subset of the comedy genre, at one point noting "All they were missing was a wise cracking sidekick for Kevin James, played by a rapper."Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film three out of four, "Look, a great movie this is not. A pleasant summer entertainment it is. I think it can play for all ages in a family audience... and besides, I'm getting a teensy bit exhausted by cute little animated animals. The creatures in this zoo all have the excellent taste to be in 2D." Sean O'Connell of the Washington Post wrote: "Pratfalls and agonizing tumbles appear to be James's business, and man, business is booming."


=== Accolades ===

Mary Pols of Time named it one of the Top 10 Worst Movies of 2011. British newspaper The Telegraph named Zookeeper one of the ten worst films of 2011, saying "Portly Kevin James is the hero of this "comedy", which boasts five screenwriters and not a single amusing moment."
