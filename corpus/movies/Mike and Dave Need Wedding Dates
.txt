== Plot ==
Brothers Mike and Dave Stangle are liquor salesmen whose antics ruin their family's gatherings. With their younger sister Jeanie's wedding in Hawaii approaching, their parents tell them they must bring dates to the wedding to keep them out of trouble. Mike and Dave put out an ad for dates on Craigslist. The ad goes viral and the brothers go on The Wendy Williams Show to advertise themselves.
Meanwhile, Tatiana and Alice are slacker party girls who have just been fired from their jobs as waitresses, because Alice showed up drunk and dancing on the tables. Tatiana sees the brothers' appearance on TV and decides that this free trip is just the vacation they need. They clean themselves up and Tatiana, to get their attention, throws herself in front of a moving car outside the bar where the brothers are meeting women. After the girls let the brothers think Mike saved Tatiana's life, they all go on a date. Tatiana, posing as a school teacher, flirts with Mike but has no intention of having sex with him. Alice, who is pretending to be a hedge fund manager, thinks sleeping with Dave is just what she needs to get over her ex-fiancé, who left her at the altar. Thinking their family will like these girls, the brothers invite them to Hawaii.
In Hawaii, Tatiana and Alice charm the Stangle family but are almost exposed when Alice, suffering PTSD-like flashbacks of her own wedding, gets drunk and makes jealous, offhanded comments to Jeanie. At the same time, Mike and his bisexual female cousin, Terry, begin competing for Tatiana's attention. The brothers book a swim-with-dolphins package for the family; however, the girls convince Jeanie and her fiancé, Eric, to take an ATV tour through the mountains instead. Alice and Tatiana show off and perform tricks on their ATVs. Mike attempts the same trick but ends up crashing into Jeanie and severely bruising her face, resulting in Burt severely telling Mike to own the issue. Alice feels bad and bribes a masseur to give Jeanie a massage with a tantric style "happy ending" to help her relax as she's feeling stressed.
Tatiana goes into a sauna and runs into Terry. She offers Tatiana backstage passes to Rihanna if Tatiana fingers her. Dave finds himself falling for Alice and opens up to her about his dream of drawing full-time. Later Mike walks in on Jeanie having an orgasm during the massage. Upon finding Tatiana and Terry together, Mike and Terry fight before he storms off and Tatiana accidentally admits the girls are only interested in the free vacation. Meanwhile, Dave and Alice connect on a walk, where she tells him she was left at the altar. When Mike tells Dave the truth about the girls, they disagree over how to handle the situation. At the rehearsal dinner, Jeanie opens up to Alice about her fears about getting married and Eric being boring. To help calm her nerves, Alice gives her ecstasy, which causes a bad trip. Mike drags Dave backstage and demands he practice their speech instead of spending more time with Alice. Mike attempts to poison Terry, but Dave prevents him from doing so, which results in Dave refusing to give the speech and quitting the business to draw. They get into an argument; Dave confronts Mike over Mike's heinous nature and reveals the truth of how Mike attempted to poison Terry, and Mike reveals what happened in the massage parlor — unaware that they are being broadcast over the speaker system. The argument gets physical in front of the entire wedding party and Mike shoves Dave on the stage and inadvertently ruins the rehearsal dinner. In the aftermath of it, Burt (who heard Mike's confession over the speaker system) scolds Mike for his actions.
Jeanie and Alice take off their clothes and release a stable of horses, while Tatiana apologizes to Mike and they relate over how similar they are. After yelling at Alice, Dave gets them both back to the resort, where Jeanie and Eric (who gets mad about the massage) get into an argument and call off the wedding. The next day, the brothers make up and agree to work together to get the wedding back on track. At the same time, Tatiana and Alice feel guilty and also agree to fix the wedding. All four of them go to Jeanie and Eric's room to apologize, which ends in an argument over who is more at fault. Eric silences and berates all of them, and gives Jeanie an early honeymoon present: tickets for a hot air balloon ride, which is what Jeanie wanted for their honeymoon even though Eric is afraid of heights. With the wedding back on, the four scramble to get a venue for the reception and food for dinner since everything's been cancelled. Jeanie and Eric end up getting married outside the stables. After the wedding, Tatiana and Mike decide to get into business together. Alice deletes her wedding video before making out with Dave in front of everyone. The brothers stated that they never got to give their speech at the rehearsal dinner last night because they ruined it with a physical argument and perform a heartfelt duet to celebrate Jeanie's marriage. Alice and Tatiana then join them for a raunchy dance number. The fireworks display the brothers set off catches fire, scattering the wedding party. Tatiana and Mike later have sex in the stables.

The site's critics consensus reads, "Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates benefits from the screwball premise and the efforts of a game cast, even if the sporadically hilarious results don't quite live up to either." On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 51 out of 100, based on 32 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of "B" on an A+ to F scale.Aubrey Plaza's performance was particularly praised, and is often noted as a highlight of the film. The Guardian wrote, "Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates is very much an ensemble comedy, but much like A Fish Called Wanda earned Kevin Kline the Oscar, Plaza’s ineffable style of comedy (which weirdly teeters between broad farce and muted disinterest) suits the material so perfectly she leaves the others in the dust." Variety stated "where the comedy really takes off, Aubrey Plaza, who was so sharp playing a good girl pretending to be bad in The To Do List, is even sharper playing a bad girl pretending to be good. She’s got a face made for deception — she’s like a devil doll, eyebrows lowering with cunning — and her line readings are killer."
